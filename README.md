# Hey, I'm Akshay 👋

Software engineer building at the intersection of **AI, robotics, and real-world systems**.

Currently pursuing my **MS in Computer Science at CSU Chico**, with a focus on computer vision, distributed systems, and machine learning.

## What I'm Working On

- 🤖 Edge-deployed AI systems with ROS 2 and LLMs
- 🔍 RAG pipelines and intelligent retrieval systems
- 🚗 Real-time computer vision for autonomous driving
- 🏔️ Previously led 80+ Himalayan expeditions — still chasing peaks

## Background

3+ years of full-stack experience shipping production systems — from booking platforms handling 35K+ annual bookings to interactive educational labs serving 8M+ users.

I like building things that work in the real world, not just in notebooks.
